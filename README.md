## Welcome to Resume Builder

### Get started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Required to install dependencies for running locally.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Access it on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
Keep the `Developer mode` active on your browser since runtime and lint errors may appear on the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
